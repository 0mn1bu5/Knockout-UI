I had a number of components lying around so I thought I would start this project to share what I had and get feedback and suggestions from the Knockout community. \r\n\r\nMost of the components use existing JQuery UI functionality where possible (e.g Autocomplete). Hence this project is not framework agnostic.\r\n\r\nI hope you find something useful here.\r\n\r\nIncluded :\r\n----------\r\n\r\n* Tree\r\n* Autocomplete\r\n* Dropdown\r\n* Context Menu\r\n* Window Manager\r\n* Tabs\r\n* Editor - This is an experimental contenteditable rich text editor, and is designed only for the latest browsers.\r\n\r\nIn the pipeline :\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n* All components accept overrides for templates.\r\n* Skinned Radio/Checkbox\r\n* Grid\r\n* Flickr Gallery\r\n* Tooltip\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense: MIT [http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php)\r\n","name":"Knockout-ui"}
